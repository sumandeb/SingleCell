This link talks about DNA cloning in a simplified manner. Using restriction enzymes, the gene (to be cloned) is cut from the DNA and then inserted into a plasmid (which is a circular genetic material outside the DNA) with the help of DNA ligase. The plasmid is then inserted into another bacteria, usually of E. Coli, by applying heat shock. Some E.Coli cells accept the plasmid wheareas others don't. The E. Coli bacteria are then allowed to multiply in a cell-culture dish by providing nutrients and favourable temperature. The E.Coli which didnt accept the plasmids are prevented from growing by: i) injecting antibiotic-resistant gene into the plasmid prior to heat shock. ii) providing anti-biotics along with nutrients in the cell-culture dish. E. Coli which didn't accept the plasmid perish in the presence of antibiotics. The E.Coli which accepted the plasmid grow and reproduce. The plasmids containing the gene-to-be-cloned get replicated along with them.
